  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  This application was created to generate a high-quality, professional README depending on a series of questions a user answers in their command line using Node.js
  For one thing, it will most likely be the first place that potential employers look to evaluate your skills and professionalism. And it also allows you to connect with and showcase your work to other developers, which can lead to interesting collaborations.
  This README generator will allow the user to answer a series of specific questions and create a professional complete README based on their responses. It will take a couple minutes and provide the developer with the ability to make their project complete and more professional, increasing the likely hood that someone will want to use their app over similar apps without a README.
  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
  Download it through GitHub
  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
